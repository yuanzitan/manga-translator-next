# Input, Detection, and Rearrangement Debug Artifacts

When an image "detects no text", "boxes are misplaced", or "a long image is split oddly", enable "Settings → General → Verbose Logging", run again, and inspect the input image, detection-box debug images, and long-image rearrangement batches in the per-image debug folder under `result/`. This guide documents when these artifacts are generated, what they show, and how to use them for troubleshooting, with emphasis on the difference between input/detection artifacts and the two long-image rearrangement branches `rearrange_{n}.png` and `yolo_rearrange_{n}.png`.

For the overall debug-folder naming and structure, see [Debug folder naming and overview](./folder-naming-and-overview.md); for OCR and text-region artifacts, see [OCR and text regions](./ocr-and-text-regions.md); for mask, inpainting, and rendering artifacts, see [Mask, inpainting, and rendering](./mask-inpainting-and-rendering.md). This page never shows real `.env` files, user images, private absolute paths, or real API keys; sanitize debug images and paths before sharing.

## What to inspect {#feature-boundary}

- Every artifact on this page is gated by the “Verbose Logging” switch: when it is off, no per-image debug subfolder is created and the detection stage writes no debug image.
- `input.png`, `mask_raw.png`, `bboxes_with_scores.png`, `mask_binary.png`, `hybrid_detection_boxes.png`, `bboxes_unfiltered.png`, `bboxes_unfiltered_labeled.png`, and `bboxes.png` are the "input/detection-stage" debug artifacts.
- `rearrange_{n}.png` and `yolo_rearrange_{n}.png` are produced only when the image satisfies the long-image rearrangement condition; they are conditional artifacts, not files every run must contain.
- The two rearrangement artifacts belong to different branches: the main detectors (default/DBConvNext/CTD) produce `rearrange_{n}.png`; the YOLO OBB auxiliary detector produces `yolo_rearrange_{n}.png` when “Enable YOLO Detection” is on.
- These files are terminal diagnostics: a static search found no later read-back of these filenames inside the repository; the consumers are operators troubleshooting a run or recipients of an issue report.

## Inspect debug artifacts {#ui-operations}

### Enable verbose logging and collect input/detection artifacts {#enable-verbose-and-collect}

1. Open “Settings” and select the “General” group.
2. Enable “Verbose Logging”.
3. Start translating. With it enabled, each input image creates a `{timestamp}-{image-md5}-{detection-size}-{target-lang}-{translator}` subfolder under `result/`, and the detection stage writes `input.png` and detection-box debug images.
4. When troubleshooting, open the files in the order "input image → detection boxes → rearrangement batches" and compare them with the tables on this page to locate the failing stage.

### Tune detection and long-image rearrangement parameters {#tune-detection-parameters}

Open “Settings” → “Detection”. “Detection Size” is both the regular detection scaling size and the target size of long-image rearrangement; “Long Image Rearrange Min Short Side” controls the effective short-side resolution preserved when packing batches; “Enable YOLO Detection” decides whether `yolo_rearrange_{n}.png` and `hybrid_detection_boxes.png` are produced.

## Input and detection-box debug artifacts {#input-and-detection-artifacts}

The table below lists, in detection-stage order, the debug artifacts owned by this page.

| Artifact | Write point | Trigger | What it shows | Troubleshooting use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `input.png` | `manga_translator/manga_translator.py` `_translate_until_translation()` | `verbose=True` | The input image before processing (converted RGB→BGR when saved) | Confirm the image fed to the pipeline; check it first when detection/OCR looks wrong |
| `mask_raw.png` | `manga_translator/manga_translator.py` (after detection returns `ctx.mask_raw`) | `verbose=True` and detection returned a raw mask | Confidence heatmap with color mapping and a "Confidence" color bar (`_create_confidence_heatmap`) | Detection-threshold and missed-text troubleshooting |
| `bboxes_with_scores.png` | `manga_translator/manga_translator.py` (when the detector's third return is a debug tuple or image) | `verbose=True`, detector returned a scored-box debug image | Scored detection boxes overlaid by the detector | Detector-internal debug output |
| `mask_binary.png` | Same as above (binary/triple debug tuple) | Same as above | Binary mask paired with the scored-box image | Detection-output troubleshooting |
| `hybrid_detection_boxes.png` | Same as above (third return is an image and `use_yolo_obb=True`) | `verbose=True`, `use_yolo_obb=True` | Boxes after merging main detection with YOLO OBB (from the dispatch's `draw_detection_debug_image`) | Hybrid-detection merge troubleshooting |
| `bboxes_unfiltered.png` | `manga_translator/manga_translator.py` (after detection, before OCR) | `verbose=True` and text lines remain after detection | Unfiltered text-line boxes on the image (boxes labeled `other` are skipped) | Detection/OCR filtering troubleshooting |
| `bboxes_unfiltered_labeled.png` | `manga_translator/manga_translator.py` → `_save_labeled_textline_debug_image()` | Previous condition, `ocr.merge_special_require_full_wrap=True`, and non-empty text lines | Colored text-line boxes with `index:label` captions (colored per label) | Model-assisted merge / label-routing troubleshooting |
| `bboxes.png` | `manga_translator/manga_translator.py` (after textline merge) | `verbose=True` and `ctx.text_regions` exists | Final text-block visualization (whether panels are shown depends on `force_simple_sort`) | Merge/sort troubleshooting |

## Long-image rearrangement: trigger and splitting {#rearrange-trigger-and-splitting}

The rearrangement plan first normalizes along the long side: if `h < w` it transposes so that `h` is the long side. It computes `down_scale_ratio = h / tgt_size` (`tgt_size` is `detector.detection_size`, default `2048`) and `asp_ratio = h / w`; rearrangement is required only when `down_scale_ratio > 2.5` and `asp_ratio > 3`; otherwise the regular forward path is used.

When rearranging, the long strip is cut into stripes and packed by `pw_num`: `pw_num` is derived from the "no-downscale stripe count `floor(tgt_size / w)`", the "resolution cap computed from `det_rearrange_min_effective_short_side`", and the "legacy cap `floor(2 * tgt_size / w)`"; each composed batch packs `pw_num` stripes side by side. Each batch is padded and resized to a `tgt_size × tgt_size` square before entering the network. Detection outputs are mapped back to original-image coordinates, and overlapping stripe regions are merged with feather weighting based on distance from the stripe cut edges, so text cut at a seam does not lose boxes.

Adjacent stripes are additionally forced to keep a "minimum overlap of 200px" (`DET_REARRANGE_MIN_OVERLAP`): the stripe count is derived from `max_step = ph - 200`, starts are spread evenly with the first and last pinned to the edges, and the count grows automatically (guarded to 8 rounds) when a neighbouring step still exceeds the cap; `ph_step` is the median of the adjacent steps. The cost is more stripes and more detection time on longer images.

The detection candidate cap defaults to 1000, but it is now applied after scoring, keeping the highest-scoring boxes instead of truncating in `findContours` order; for long images the reassembled contour count far exceeds one page, so the cap is lifted entirely (`max_candidates=None`). Boxes are therefore neither dropped by contour order nor lost past the 1000-box limit, and no zero-filled placeholder boxes are returned.

```

Rearrangement avoids shrinking an extremely long image down to the detection size, which would make text too small; packing batches also bounds the VRAM used by each network call. A higher `det_rearrange_min_effective_short_side` packs fewer stripes per batch and preserves a higher effective short-side resolution, making text clearer but detection slower (matching the settings description).

## Rearrangement artifact branches {#rearrange-artifact-branches}

### `rearrange_{n}.png`: square padded batches of the main detector {#rearrange-artifact-main}

The write point is `det_rearrange_forward()` → `_patch2batches()` in `manga_translator/utils/generic.py`. Triggers: the default, DBConvNext, or CTD detector calls `det_rearrange_forward()`, the image satisfies the `build_det_rearrange_plan()` condition, and `verbose=True`. Content: the square padded batches fed to the detection network — each `{n}` is one composed batch (`pw_num` stripes side by side, padded to `tgt_size`), used to troubleshoot long-image rearrangement: check whether cutting/packing is correct, stripes are complete, and the padding direction is as expected. With verbose, the console prints an "Input image will be rearranged to square batches..." notice.

### `yolo_rearrange_{n}.png`: single YOLO OBB rearrange patch {#rearrange-artifact-yolo}

The write point is `_rearrange_detect_unified()` in `manga_translator/detection/yolo_obb.py`. Triggers: `use_yolo_obb=True`, YOLO OBB also receives a long-image rearrangement plan, the current patch is valid (not an all-zero padding patch and not empty), and `verbose=True`. Content: a single YOLO OBB rearrange patch — YOLO OBB uses the same `build_det_rearrange_plan()` splitting logic as the main detector, so its cuts should match `rearrange_{n}.png`, helping hybrid-detection long-image troubleshooting. All-zero padding patches are skipped, so the indices `{n}` may be non-contiguous.

## Paths and fallbacks {#paths-and-fallbacks}

- The regular detection dispatch passes `self._result_path` as `result_path_fn` to detectors in `_run_detection()`, so both rearrangement artifacts land in the per-image debug folder by default: `result/<timestamp>-<md5>-<detection-size>-<target-lang>-<translator>/rearrange_{n}.png` and `yolo_rearrange_{n}.png` in the same folder.
- When no callback is provided, `det_rearrange_forward()` falls back to `result/rearrange_{n}.png` at the repository root (`generic.py`), and YOLO OBB falls back to `result/yolo_rearrange_{n}.png` (`yolo_obb.py`). In the current source, the call in `manga_translator/utils/ctd_replace.py` does not pass the callback; the regular detection dispatch does.
- The debug-folder name contains the input image MD5; do not put a path containing a user-image MD5 into a public report. Debug PNGs can directly contain pixels of the user image; check every file before sharing.

## Parameters and options {#parameters-and-options}

> Detailed parameter information (UI names, storage keys, default values, and effective stages) on this page is in the [debug artifact reference index](../reference/debug-artifact-index.md).

#### Detection Size {#detection-size}

“Detection Size” is an integer input in Settings → Detection. It sets the scaling size for regular detection and is also the target size of long-image rearrangement. For details, see [Detection](../desktop/settings/detection.md).

#### Long Image Rearrange Min Short Side {#det-rearrange-min-effective-short-side}

“Long Image Rearrange Min Short Side” is an integer input in Settings → Detection. It constrains the effective short-side resolution preserved when packing long-image rearrangement batches. For details, see [Detection](../desktop/settings/detection.md).

#### Enable YOLO Detection {#use-yolo-obb}

“Enable YOLO Detection” is a switch in Settings → Detection. When enabled, the detection dispatch runs YOLO oriented-bounding-box detection after the main detector and merges the results; when disabled, only the main detector runs. For details, see [Detection](../desktop/settings/detection.md).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Off["use_yolo_obb off"]
        O1["Main detector detect()"] --> O2["Only main detection boxes"]
    end
    subgraph On["use_yolo_obb on"]
        P1["Main detector detect()"] --> P2["YOLO OBB: regular forward or _rearrange_detect_unified (long image)"]
        P2 --> P3["merge_detection_boxes merge"]
        P3 --> P4["Main + YOLO merged boxes"]
        P2 -. "verbose and long image" .-> P5["yolo_rearrange_{n}.png"]
        P3 -. "verbose" .-> P6["hybrid_detection_boxes.png"]
    end
```

#### Verbose Logging {#cli-verbose}

“Verbose Logging” is a switch in Settings → General. It is the master switch for the debug artifacts on this page: when enabled, each input image gets its own debug subfolder with the debug images listed on this page, and the console log level is raised. For details, see [CLI, Batch, and Output](../desktop/settings/cli-batch-and-output.md).

## Artifacts and privacy {#dependencies-and-conflicts}

- Every artifact depends on `verbose=True`; when disabled, `result/` gets no per-image debug folder.
- Early exit on no text (no text lines after detection) skips `bboxes_unfiltered*.png` and the later `bboxes.png`; `bboxes_unfiltered_labeled.png` additionally depends on `ocr.merge_special_require_full_wrap`.
- `hybrid_detection_boxes.png` and `yolo_rearrange_{n}.png` depend on `use_yolo_obb`; `import_yolo_labels` replaces the final detection boxes, but the detection dispatch still runs first (rearrangement artifacts may still exist with verbose).
- Long-image rearrangement artifacts are conditional: they do not appear for ordinary images, a large enough `detection_size`, or non-extreme aspect ratios.
- Do not present "artifacts that actually exist in one run" as "always produced"; do not zip and upload a debug folder directly, and note that the `mask_raw` heatmap and rearrangement batches may contain user-image content.
